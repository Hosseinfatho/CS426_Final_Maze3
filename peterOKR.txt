Schedule and deliverable:
    - Fri 03/08 - by end of the day - 5h?:
        basic test scene with player character movement
        (have character "stick" to the cube's surface and
        move over the edges, or in other words have gravity
        always pointing to the face of the cube currently occupied by the player)
    - Mon 03/11 - by end of the day - 3h?:
        make player controls work properly when changing faces
        (so character moved predictably, and no movement axis is inverted)

    - ??? - ??h:
        figure out the movement dependent on the camera position
        (so pressing W always moves the player towards the top of the screen)
    - ??? - ??h:
        make camera follow the player and snap back to some position
        (so player doesn't need to manually rotate the cube if went over the edge)
