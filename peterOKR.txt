Schedule and deliverable:
    - Fri 03/08 - by end of the day - 5h?:
        basic test scene with player character movement
        (have character "stick" to the cube's surface and
        move over the edges, or in other words have gravity
        always pointing to the face of the cube currently occupied by the player)
    - Sun 03/10 - by end of the day - 3h?:
        make player controls relative to the camera position
        (so pressing 'w' always moves the player towards the top of the screen)
