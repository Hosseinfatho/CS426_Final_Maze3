## Introduction:
A 3D Unity game where a player must navigate a maze that may extend to all six sides of a cube using environmental manipulation, player movement, and memory skills. This project was created as part of the Game Design course at UIC (CS 426) during the Spring 2024 semester.

## Procedure
In this game, the player controls a robot on the scene, guiding it to complete its mission. The mission of this robot is to deliver suitable packages to their designated locations. Meanwhile, the robot must navigate through intricate pathways, intelligently avoiding the hazards that may jeopardize its success. These hazards could deduct points from its score or even lead to its demise if confronted by the main enemy under certain circumstances, ending the game. Therefore, the player must carefully observe the designated routes and warnings provided for the robot, deciding what actions to take at the opportune moments.

## This game utilizes a variety of tools to enhance its completeness and appeal:

1-Lighting: Several types of lighting are employed to create different moods and add allure to the game.
2-Sound: Over 8 different types of sounds are included, such as background noise, mode change effects, collision sounds, pathway start and end signals, and more.
3- Textures: Various textures are used to imbue both the NPC game and the player with a better sense of immersion into the gaming environment.
4- User Interface (UI): While the game features a large number of UI elements, they are not overwhelming. At the beginning of the game, several selectable options are provided for starting and setting game conditions. Additionally, in-game UI elements are incorporated to alert the player to make correct pathway choices and to indicate dangers.
5- Animations: Various animations are seen throughout the game, both for players and enemies, displaying different reactions based on different conditions and effectively conveying appropriate emotions to the player.
6- Artificial Intelligence (AI): Several AI tricks are embedded in the game to enhance its appeal, focusing primarily on patrol routes, flocking, and pursuit techniques.
7- Shadowing: Different shaders are used to beautify elements and provide a more natural look to the game. They even change in some cases to convey feelings and offer warnings to the player.
